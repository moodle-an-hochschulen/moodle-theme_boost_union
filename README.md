========================

[![Moodle Plugin CI](https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union/workflows/Moodle%20Plugin%20CI/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union/actions?query=workflow%3A%22Moodle+Plugin+CI%22+branch%3Amaster)

Theme Boost Union is an enhanced child theme of Boost which is intended, on the one hand, to make Boost simply more configurable and, on the other hand, to provide helpful additional features for the daily Moodle operation of admins, teachers and students.


Requirements
------------

This theme requires Moodle 4.0+


Motivation for this theme
-------------------------

The Boost theme in Moodle core is not really configurable, many things are hardcoded and can only be changed with tricks or with core hacks. This theme intends to provider simple settings for admins to let them configure important settings easily without thinking about the inner workings of the theme.

On the other hand, many Moodle installations share the same basic functional needs like the possibility to add an imprint page or a footnote. This theme intends to provide these basic features without needing to fiddle with other plugins.

One highlight is the main design principle of Boost Union: As soon as it is activated on a Moodle site, it does not change anything yet and simply behaves as Boost from Moodle core does. The admin can enable and configure only the theme features he needs and does not need to care about side effects from other, disabled theme features.


Installation
------------

Install the theme like any other theme to folder
/theme/boost_union

See http://docs.moodle.org/en/Installing_plugins for details on installing Moodle plugins


Usage & Settings
----------------

After installing the theme, it does not do anything to Moodle yet.

To configure the theme and its behaviour, please visit:
Site administration -> Appearance -> Themes -> Boost Union.

There, you find multiple setting pages:

### Settings page "Look"

#### Tab "General settings"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### Theme presets

###### Theme preset

This setting is already available in the Moodle core theme Boost. For more information how to use it, please have a look at the official Moodle documentation: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Boost_theme

###### Additional theme preset files

This setting is already available in the Moodle core theme Boost. For more information how to use it, please have a look at the official Moodle documentation: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Boost_theme

#### Background image

This setting is already available in the Moodle core theme Boost. For more information how to use it, please have a look at the official Moodle documentation: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Boost_theme
Please note: This will not override the setting "theme_boost_campus | loginbackgroundimage" which means that the pictures uploaded to the login page background will be displayed anyway.

#### Tab "Advanced settings"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### Raw SCSS

###### Raw initial SCSS

This setting is already available in the Moodle core theme Boost. For more information how to use it, please have a look at the official Moodle documentation: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Boost_theme

###### Raw SCSS

This setting is already available in the Moodle core theme Boost. For more information how to use it, please have a look at the official Moodle documentation: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Boost_theme

#### Tab "Page"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### Layout

###### Course content max width

With this setting, you can override Moodle's default content width without manual SCSS modifications.

#### Tab "Branding"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### Favicon

###### Favicon

Here, you can upload a custom image (.ico or .png format) that the browser will show as the favicon of your Moodle website. If no custom favicon is uploaded, a standard Moodle favicon will be used.

##### Background images

###### General background image

This setting is already available in the Moodle core theme Boost. For more information how to use it, please have a look at the official Moodle documentation: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Boost_theme
Please note: This will not interfere with the setting "theme_boost_union | loginbackgroundimage" which means that the pictures uploaded here will be shown on all pages except the login page.

##### Login page background images

###### Login page background images

This setting is already available in the Moodle core theme Boost.
However, in Boost Union you can not only add one but up to 25 files as a background image for the login page. One of these images will be picked randomly and shown when the user visits the login page.

###### Display text for login background images

With this optional setting you can add text, e.g. a copyright notice to your uploaded login background images.
Each line consists of the file identifier (the file name) and the text that should be displayed, separated by a pipe character. Each declaration needs to be written in a new line.

For example:
``background-image-1.jpg|Copyright: CC0|dark``

As text color, you can use the values "dark" or "light".

You can declare texts for a arbitrary amount of your uploaded login background images. The texts will be added only to those images that match their filename with the identifier declared in this setting.

##### Brand colors

###### Brand color

This setting is already available in the Moodle core theme Boost. For more information how to use it, please have a look at the official Moodle documentation: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Boost_theme

##### Bootstrap colors

With these settings, you can overwrite the Bootstrap colors which are used within the Moodle GUI.

##### Activity icon colors

With these settings, you can overwrite the activity icon colors which are used within courses.

#### Tab "E-Mail branding"

In this tab, you find a feature which you can use to apply branding to all E-Mails which Moodle is sending out.

Please note: This is an advanced functionality which uses some workarounds to provide E-Mail branding options. Please follow the instructions closely.

#### Tab "Resources"

##### Additional resources

With this setting you can upload additional resources to the theme. The advantage of uploading files to this file area is that those files can be delivered without a check if the user is logged in. This is also why you should only add files that are uncritical and everyone should be allowed to access and don't need be protected with a valid login. As soon as you have uploaded at least one file to this filearea and have stored the settings, a list will appear underneath which will give you the URL which you can use to reference a particular file.

##### Custom fonts

With this setting you can upload custom fonts to the theme. The advantage of uploading fonts to this file area is that those fonts can be delivered without a check if the user is logged in and can be used as locally installed fonts everywhere on the site. As soon as you have uploaded at least one font to this filearea and have stored the settings, a list will appear underneath which will give you CSS code snippets which you can use as a boilerplate to reference particular fonts in your custom SCSS.

##### FontAwesome

Moodle core ships with FontAwesome 4 icons which are fine, but FontAwesome has evolved since then. If you want to use more recent FontAwesome icons, you can do this with this setting. As soon as you choose another version than FontAwesome 4, additional settings will appear where you can upload more recent FontAwesome versions.

### Settings page "Feel"

#### Tab "Navigation"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### Navigation

###### Back to top button

With this setting a back to top button will appear in the bottom right corner of the page as soon as the user scrolls down the page. A button like this existed already on Boost in Moodle Core until Moodle 3.11, but was removed in 4.0. With Boost Union, you can bring it back.

###### Scrollspy

With this setting, upon toggling edit mode on and off, the scroll position at where the user was when performing the toggle is preserved.

###### Activity navigation

With this setting the elements to jump to the previous and next activity/resource as well as the pull down menu to jump to a distinct activity/resource become displayed. UI elements like this existed already on Boost in Moodle Core until Moodle 3.11, but were removed in 4.0. With Boost Union, you can bring them back.

#### Tab "Blocks"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### General blocks

###### Unneeded blocks

This setting is already available in the Moodle core theme Boost. For more information how to use it, please have a look at the official Moodle documentation: http://docs.moodle.org/en/Boost_theme

#### Tab "Miscellaneous"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### JavaScript

###### JavaScript disabled hint

With this setting, a hint will appear at the top of the Moodle page if JavaScript is not enabled. This is particularly helpful as several Moodle features do not work without JavaScript.

### Settings page "Content"

#### Tab "Footer"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### Footnote

###### Footnote

Whatever you add to this textarea will be displayed at the end of a page, in the footer. Refer to the setting description on the settings page for further instructions.

#### Tab "Static pages"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### Imprint

With these settings, you can add rich text content which will be shown on the imprint page.

#### Tab "Information banners"

In this tab, you can enable and configure multiple information banners to be shown on selected pages.

### Settings page "Functionality"

#### Tab "Courses"

In this tab there are the following settings:

##### Course related hints

###### Show hint for switched role

With this setting a hint will appear in the course header if the user has switched the role in the course.

###### Show hint in hidden courses

With this setting a hint will appear in the course header as long as the visibility of the course is hidden.

###### Show hint for guest access

With this setting a hint will appear in the course header when a user is accessing it with the guest access feature.

###### Show hint for self enrolment without enrolment key

With this setting a hint will appear in the course header if the course is visible and an enrolment without enrolment key is currently possible.


Capabilities
------------

This plugin also introduces these additional capabilities:

How this theme works
--------------------

This Boost child theme is implemented with minimal code duplication in mind. It inherits / requires as much code as possible from theme_boost and only implements the extended or modified functionalities.


Plugin repositories
-------------------

This plugin is published and regularly updated in the Moodle plugins repository:
http://moodle.org/plugins/view/theme_boost_union

The latest development version can be found on Github:
https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union


Bug and problem reports / Support requests
------------------------------------------

This plugin is carefully developed and thoroughly tested, but bugs and problems can always appear.

Please report bugs and problems on Github:
https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union/issues

We will do our best to solve your problems, but please note that due to limited resources we can't always provide per-case support.


Feature proposals
-----------------

Due to limited resources, the functionality of this plugin is primarily implemented for our own local needs and published as-is to the community. We are aware that members of the community will have other needs and would love to see them solved by this plugin.

Please issue feature proposals on Github:
https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union/issues

Please create pull requests on Github:
https://github.com/moodle-an-hochschulen/moodle-theme_boost_union/pulls

We are always interested to read about your feature proposals or even get a pull request from you, but please accept that we can handle your issues only as feature _proposals_ and not as feature _requests_.


Moodle release support
----------------------

Due to limited resources, this plugin is only maintained for the most recent major release of Moodle as well as the most recent LTS release of Moodle. Bugfixes are backported to the LTS release. However, new features and improvements are not necessarily backported to the LTS release.

Apart from these maintained releases, previous versions of this plugin which work in legacy major releases of Moodle are still available as-is without any further updates in the Moodle Plugins repository.

There may be several weeks after a new major release of Moodle has been published until we can do a compatibility check and fix problems if necessary. If you encounter problems with a new major release of Moodle - or can confirm that this plugin still works with a new major release - please let us know on Github.

If you are running a legacy version of Moodle, but want or need to run the latest version of this plugin, you can get the latest version of the plugin, remove the line starting with $plugin->requires from version.php and use this latest plugin version then on your legacy Moodle. However, please note that you will run this setup completely at your own risk. We can't support this approach in any way and there is an undeniable risk for erratic behavior.


Translating this theme
----------------------

This Moodle plugin is shipped with an english language pack only. All translations into other languages must be managed through AMOS (https://lang.moodle.org) by what they will become part of Moodle's official language pack.

As the plugin creator, we manage the translation into german for our own local needs on AMOS. Please contribute your translation into all other languages in AMOS where they will be reviewed by the official language pack maintainers for Moodle.


Right-to-left support
---------------------

This plugin has not been tested with Moodle's support for right-to-left (RTL) languages.
If you want to use this plugin with a RTL language and it doesn't work as-is, you are free to send us a pull request on Github with modifications.
