/**
 * Snippet Title: Debugging footer
 * Scope:         global
 * Goal:          devsonly
 * Description:   By default, the performance footer in Moodle aligns with the content width and integrates in the page layout in a suboptimal way. This snippet changes the performance footer to be full-width and 'below the fold'. Additionally, it slightly improves the content styling in the performance footer as well.
 * Creator:       Alexander Bias
 * Tested on:     Moodle 5.0, Firefox for Mac
