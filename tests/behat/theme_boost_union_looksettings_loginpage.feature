    Then the "class" attribute of "body" "css_element" should contain "path-login"
    And the "class" attribute of "body" "css_element" should not contain "loginbackgroundimage"
    And the "class" attribute of "body" "css_element" should not contain "loginbackgroundimage1"

    # However, the random image picking function is designed to detect Behat runs and will then always ship the
    # image matching the number of uploaded images (i.e. if you upload 3 images, you will get the third).
    And the "class" attribute of "body" "css_element" should contain "loginbackgroundimage3"
