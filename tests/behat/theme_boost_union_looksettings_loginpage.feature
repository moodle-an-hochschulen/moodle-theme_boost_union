    And the "class" attribute of "body" "css_element" should not contain "loginbackgroundimage"
    And the "class" attribute of "body" "css_element" should not contain "loginbackgroundimage1"

    # image matching the number of uploaded images (i.e. if you upload 3 images, you will get the third).
    And the "class" attribute of "body" "css_element" should contain "loginbackgroundimage3"
