Feature: Configuring the theme_boost_union plugin for the "Activity branding" tab on the "Look" page
  In order to use the features
  As admin
  I need to be able to configure the theme Boost Union plugin

  Background:
    Given the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname | shortname |
      | Course 1 | C1        |

  Scenario Outline: Setting: Activity icon colors - Setting the color
    Given the following config values are set as admin:

      | activityiconcolor<purposename> | <colorhex> | theme_boost_union |
      | activityiconcolorfidelity      | 500        | theme_boost_union |
    And the theme cache is purged and the theme is reloaded
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I am on "Course 1" course homepage
    And I turn editing mode on
    And I click on "Add an activity or resource" "button" in the "New section" "section"
    # First, we test that the default filter is _not_ set anymore.
    Then DOM element ".chooser-container .activityiconcontainer.modicon_<modname> img" should not have computed style "filter" "<originalfilter>"
    # And then, as the hex color to CSS filter conversion results are not reproducible, we test if the applied filter is close enough to the hex color.
    And DOM element ".chooser-container .activityiconcontainer.modicon_<modname> img" should have a CSS filter close enough to hex color "<colorhex>"

    # Unfortunately, we can only test 4 out of 6 purpose types as Moodle does does not ship with any activity with the
    # administration and interface types. But this should be an acceptable test coverage anyway.
    Examples:
      | purposename        | modname | colorhex | originalfilter                                                                              |

    And I turn editing mode on
    And I add a <mod> activity to course "Course 1" section "0" and I fill the form with:
      | <titlesetting> | Test name |
    Then DOM element ".activity.modtype_<mod> .activityiconcontainer.courseicon img" should have computed style "filter" "<filter>"
    And I click on "Add an activity or resource" "button" in the "New section" "section"
    Then DOM element ".chooser-container .activityiconcontainer.modicon_<mod> img" should have computed style "filter" "<filter>"
    And I am on the "Test name" "<mod> activity" page
    Then DOM element "#page-header .modicon_<mod>.activityiconcontainer img" should have computed style "filter" "<filter>"

    # We do not want to burn too much CPU time by testing all plugins. We just test two plugins which is fine as all plugins are handled with the same PHP code.
    # In addition to that, we test the 'other purpose' which is special.
    # These examples will work until Moodle core changes the default colors of the module purpose types.
