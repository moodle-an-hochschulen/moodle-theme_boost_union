  Scenario: Setting: Raw CSS for H5P - Add custom SCSS to a mod_h5p content type
    When I log in as "admin"
    And I navigate to "Appearance > Boost Union > Look" in site administration
    And I click on "H5P" "link" in the "#adminsettings .nav-tabs" "css_element"
    # We add a small CSS snippet to the page which makes the H5P content red.
    # This is just to make it easy to detect the effect of this custom CSS code.
    And I set the field "Raw CSS for H5P" to multiline:
    """
    .h5p-accordion {
        color: #FF0000 !important;
    }
    """

    And I wait until the page is ready
    And I switch to "h5p-player" class iframe
    And I switch to "h5p-iframe" class iframe
    Then DOM element "#h5p-panel-content-0-0" should have computed style "color" "rgb(255, 0, 0)"

  # Unfortunately, this can't be tested with Behat yet, cause the mod_hvp plugin only works when
  # php warnings don't trigger the shutdown handler. See https://github.com/h5p/moodle-mod_hvp/issues/487.
