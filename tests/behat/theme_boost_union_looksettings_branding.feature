    # We can't check the uploaded favicon visually, but we can verify that the site's favicon is not shipped by pluginfile.php (for uploaded files) and not by theme/image.php (for image files from disk) anymore.
    Then "//head//link[contains(@rel, 'shortcut')][contains(@href, 'pluginfile.php/1/theme_boost_union/favicon')][contains(@href, 'favicon.ico')]" "xpath_element" should exist
    And "//head//link[contains(@rel, 'shortcut')][contains(@href, 'theme/image.php/boost_union/theme')][contains(@href, 'favicon')]" "xpath_element" should not exist

    # image matching the number of uploaded images (i.e. if you upload 3 images, you will get the third).
