  In order to use the features
  As admin
  I need to be able to configure the theme Boost Union plugin

  Background:
    Given the following "categories" exist:

      | Cat 2  | 0        | CAT2     |
    And the following "courses" exist:
      | fullname  | shortname | category |
      | Course 1  | C1        | CAT1     |
